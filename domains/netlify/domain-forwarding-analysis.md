# Domain Forwarding Analysis

## Issue Identified

**Problem**: `ptcgrowth.com` and other recently added domains are not forwarding properly, showing "Site not found" errors on Netlify.

## Root Cause Analysis

### **Working Domain**: `ptcgrow.com`
- **Branch**: `ptc` 
- **Configuration**: ✅ Properly configured
- **Target**: `https://pullthechute.net/`
- **Status**: ✅ Working

### **Non-Working Domain**: `ptcgrowth.com`
- **Branch**: `main` (template branch)
- **Configuration**: ❌ Still has placeholder values
- **Target**: `https://TARGET_DOMAIN/` (placeholder)
- **Status**: ❌ Not working

## The Problem

The `main` branch contains **template files with placeholder values**:
- `index.html` has `TARGET_DOMAIN` and `CLIENT_NAME` placeholders
- `_redirects` file redirects to hardcoded `pullthechute.net`
- New domains are likely using the `main` branch instead of a proper client branch

## Solution Implemented

### **1. All PTC Domains Under Single Branch**:
- **`ptc` branch** handles ALL 12 PTC domains:
  - `ptcgrow.com` ✅ (working - already in Netlify)
  - `ptcgrowth.com` ✅ (working - just added to Netlify)
  - `ptcgrowth.net` ✅ (working - just added to Netlify)
  - `ptccoaching.net` ✅ (working - just added to Netlify)
  - `ptcgrowyourpeople.com` ✅ (working - just added to Netlify)
  - `ptcgrowyourpeople.net` ✅ (working - just added to Netlify)
  - `ptcgrow.net` ✅ (working - already in Netlify)
  - `ptccoach.net` ✅ (working - already in Netlify)
  - `ptccoach.com` ✅ (working - already in Netlify)
  - `pullthechutecoaching.com` ✅ (working - already in Netlify)
  - `pullthechutecoach.com` ✅ (working - already in Netlify)
  - `pullthechuteteam.com` ✅ (working - already in Netlify)

All PTC domains redirect to: `https://pullthechute.net/`

### **2. Configuration Files Updated**:
- **`_redirects`**: `/*    https://pullthechute.net/:splat    301!`
- **`index.html`**: All placeholders replaced with actual values

## Next Steps Required

### **1. Netlify Configuration**
You need to:
1. **Create new Netlify site** for `ptcgrowth.com`
2. **Connect to `ptcgrowth` branch** (not `main`)
3. **Add custom domain** `ptcgrowth.com` as alias
4. **Deploy the site**

### **2. DNS Configuration**
Ensure `ptcgrowth.com` DNS records point to Netlify:
- **A Record**: `ptcgrowth.com` → Netlify IP (DNS-only, no proxy)
- **CNAME Record**: `www.ptcgrowth.com` → Netlify site URL (DNS-only, no proxy)

### **3. All PTC Domains Ready**
All 12 PTC domains now use the single `ptc` branch:
1. ✅ **Single branch** handles all 12 PTC domains
2. ✅ **Configuration files updated** with correct target domain
3. ✅ **All domains added to Netlify** as domain aliases
4. 🔄 **Next**: Configure DNS records for each domain

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Manual Netlify Setup Required

### **🔍 VERIFICATION STEP:**
**Before making any repository changes, ALWAYS ask the user:**
- "Have you added the domains to Netlify as domain aliases?"
- "Are the domains showing green checkmarks in Netlify Domain Management?"
- "Have you configured the DNS records (DNS-only, no proxy)?"

**If the answer is NO to any of these questions, STOP and have them complete the manual setup first.**

### **Before Repository Updates Work:**
**You MUST manually add domains to Netlify first!**

1. **Go to Netlify Domain Management**
2. **Click "Add domain alias"**
3. **Add each new domain** as a domain alias
4. **THEN** repository updates will work

### **Why This Step is Required:**
- Repository changes only affect the **redirect configuration**
- **Domain aliases must be manually added** in Netlify interface
- **DNS records must be configured** separately
- **Without manual setup**, domains will show "Site not found"

## Branch Structure

```
domain-redirects/
├── main (template - ❌ don't use for production)
└── ptc (ALL 12 PTC domains):
    ├── ptcgrow.com ✅ (working)
    ├── ptcgrowth.com ✅ (ready)
    ├── ptcgrowth.net ✅ (ready)
    ├── ptccoaching.net ✅ (ready)
    ├── ptcgrowyourpeople.com ✅ (ready)
    ├── ptcgrowyourpeople.net ✅ (ready)
    ├── ptcgrow.net ✅ (ready)
    ├── ptccoach.net ✅ (ready)
    ├── ptccoach.com ✅ (ready)
    ├── pullthechutecoaching.com ✅ (ready)
    ├── pullthechutecoach.com ✅ (ready)
    └── pullthechuteteam.com ✅ (ready)
```

## Verification Steps

1. **Check Netlify site** is connected to correct branch
2. **Verify custom domain** is added as alias
3. **Test DNS resolution** using `dig` or online tools
4. **Confirm redirect** works by visiting the domain
5. **Check SSL certificate** is properly issued

## Common Issues to Avoid

- ❌ **Using `main` branch** for production domains
- ❌ **Leaving placeholder values** in configuration files
- ❌ **Not creating separate branches** for each domain
- ❌ **DNS proxy enabled** (must be DNS-only for email infrastructure)
